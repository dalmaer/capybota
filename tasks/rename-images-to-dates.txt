Create a python program to help with this task:

Take a directory of images and copy them to be in the format of YYYY-MM-DD-capybara.jpg
Given the initial start date, the first image should be copied to use that date, and each subsequent image should be copied to use the next day's date.

For example:

Given a directory `images/` with files such as `images/cute-capy.jpg` and `images/funny-capy.jpg`, and an initial start date of 2023-09-05, the program should output `images/2023-09-05-capybara.jpg` and `images/2023-09-06-capybara.jpg`

The command line to do this should be:

% python3 ./format-to-dates.py --start-date 2023-09-05 images/
